    Anyone with existing code based on Ext 3.x or earlier will sooner or later want to start taking advantage of the new capabilities offered by Ext 4.  From MVC to charting to infinite grid scrolling, there are many reasons to upgrade, but where to begin?  This session will provide practical strategies for migrating to Ext 4, including following the “Four R’s” of migration, dealing with common problems and pitfalls, debugging best practices, migrating custom components and much more.  We’ll introduce the Ext 3 Compatibility layer and outline how it can minimize the time and effort required to convert your existing applications to Ext 4.

    In this video tutorial series Brian Moeskau teaches you how to use the Ext compatibility layer to migrate existing Ext 3 applications to Ext 4. The tutorial covers setup, debugging, dealing with common problems, and techniques for properly updating your application code. Part 1 focuses on the initial setup of the compatibility layer and getting a demo Ext 3 application running under Ext 4 in compatibility mode.

    In this video tutorial series Brian Moeskau teaches you how to use the Ext compatibility layer to migrate existing Ext 3 applications to Ext 4. The tutorial covers setup, debugging, dealing with common problems, and techniques for properly updating your application code. Part 2 builds on the first video, migrating the demo application off of the compatibility layer and getting it fully converted to Ext 4, including using the new class system and dynamic loading.

    This guide is meant to assist developers migrating from Ext JS 4.0.x to 4.1. Our goal was to maintain API compatibility as much as possible, despite the scope of the changes we are making to address bugs and user feedback. However, some changes were needed, which you need to consider in further Ext JS development.

    Ext JS 4 has a thoroughly revamped architecture that enables faster performance and more developer flexibility. In this session, we will take a tour through the revamped architecture of Ext JS 4.x, taking a high-level look at the updated data package, component hierarchy and core APIs. Afterwards, developers will have an understanding of why Ext JS 4 works the way it does and how best to leverage its underlying APIs.
