    For readers who are new to Sencha but coming from a Flex background, this guest blog post provides useful context and reference to familiarize yourself with how Flex concepts map to Sencha concepts.
Typically, a Hello World program illustrates the quickest way to get anything (such as text) on the screen and publishing (or compiling) without errors. In this post, I have also added a few things. We see a Sencha component (Viewport), Sencha classpathing (src), a custom super class, a custom subclass, and an example of a mixin class (similar to multiple inheritance).

    This session will take a detailed look into a variety of internal and less known properties of Ext JS. Topics range from component lifecycles to properties such as renderTpl, renderSelectors, childEls, renderData, and mon. Other topics include delegated events (where the framework utilizes it, and where you should be using them in your code) and many useful utility classes like MixedCollection, DelayedTask, TaskRunner, and more.

- **(Guide)** [Mapping a Grid to a MySQL table using Direct and PHP, Part 1 of 2](http://docs.sencha.com/ext-js/4-1/#!/guide/direct_grid_pt1) <small style='color:#aaa;'>&mdash; _docs.sencha.com_</small>
    In this tutorial we will be looking at how to build a table, or 'grid', that receives its data from a MySQL database. It's aimed at people who have some familiarity with JavaScript, PHP and MySQL but are new to the Ext JS framework.

- **(Guide)** [How to map an Ext 4 Grid to a MySQL table using Ext Direct and PHP, Part 2 of 2: CRUD](http://docs.sencha.com/ext-js/4-1/#!/guide/direct_grid_pt2) <small style='color:#aaa;'>&mdash; _docs.sencha.com_</small>
    In the last tutorial we created a grid that pulled information from a MySQL database using Ext Direct. Through the power and simplicity of grids we created what was essentially a glorified table (albeit 'turbocharged'). To add to the dynamism that grids present to us we'll be adding CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) capabilities as well. A typical scenario that benefits from this is backend interfaces where a client might want to do anything from update someone's address or rename a blog post.

- **(Guide)** [Editable Grid with Node.js, Part 1 of 2](http://docs.sencha.com/ext-js/4-1/#!/guide/editable_grid) <small style='color:#aaa;'>&mdash; _docs.sencha.com_</small>
    The Grid is a powerful way to display tabular data. It is an ideal solution for displaying dynamic data from a database. It can also allow users to edit the fields of the data displayed in the grid. Changes to the dataset can be easily saved back to the server. This guide describes how to create this functionality using Ext's MVC application architecture.

- **(Guide)** [Editable Grid with Node.js, Part 2 of 2](http://docs.sencha.com/ext-js/4-1/#!/guide/editable_grid_pt2) <small style='color:#aaa;'>&mdash; _docs.sencha.com_</small>
    Since we already have the Read operation working from part 1, we are left with the Create, Update, and Delete operations to implement. Let's start with updating existing movies in our grid.

    Many Ext JS developers have yet to take advantage of Ext Direct to directly call server methods from the browser. During this session, you'll learn how to leverage Ext.Direct's existing functionality to make accessing your server data easier while eliminating common boiler-plate code. This session will spend more time on introductory material. The session repeat on Tuesday will spend more time on advanced material including developing routers, using ColdFusion as an example.

- **(Guide)** [Loading data from an AMF data source](http://docs.sencha.com/ext-js/4-1/#!/guide/amf) <small style='color:#aaa;'>&mdash; _docs.sencha.com_</small>
    Action Message Format (AMF) is a compact binary format used by Adobe Flash/Flex to serialize ActionScript object graphs. AMF is typically used to encode messages that are sent between an Adobe Flash client and a remote service. AMF is only a serialization technology, not a transport, so AMF encoded binary data can be used with any transport such as HTTP or HTTPS. This guide will show you how to use Ext JS and AJAX to consume AMF data sent over HTTP right inside a web browser, with no need for a Flash plugin. This guide assumes you are already somewhat familiar with the Ext JS Data Package and Grids.

- **(Guide)** [Using SOAP Services in Ext JS](http://docs.sencha.com/ext-js/4-1/#!/guide/soap) <small style='color:#aaa;'>&mdash; _docs.sencha.com_</small>
    SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a Web Services standard built on HTTP and XML. The SOAP Proxy and Ext.data.soap.Reader provide a convenient way to create a SOAP request, and load the SOAP response into a Ext.data.Store. This guide will show you how to use the SOAP Proxy and Reader to load data from and save data to a fictional SOAP service that provides information about blenders. This guide assumes a basic knowledge of the Ext JS Data Package.

- **(Blog)** [Taking a look at the new Sencha SOAP Data Proxy](http://www.sencha.com/blog/taking-a-look-at-the-new-sencha-soap-data-proxy/) <small style='color:#aaa;'>&mdash; _Kevin Kazmierczak_ on September 27, 2012</small>
    The Sencha data package offers a number of different proxies to connect your application to all kinds of data. With the release of Ext JS 4.1.2 in Sencha Complete: Team, developers can now point to SOAP web services. With SOAP being one of the most popular web service protocols out there, this will allow developers a new option for connecting their applications to data.
The SOAP proxy works just like the other proxies, all you need to do is configure the proxy on your store, and you don't have to worry about the details of handling the communication requests.

    We've been working on various tools that make a Sencha developer's life easier, and we started with Sencha Architect. Our new plugin makes it even easier to use Architect by providing a full set of code completion and code assistance features for Eclipse.

- **(Video)** [The &quot;In Action&quot; Pattern for RIA Development (29:31)](http://docs.sencha.com/ext-js/4-1/#!/video/18537381) <small style='color:#aaa;'>&mdash; _Jay Garcia_ on January 7, 2011</small>
    With RIAs growing in complexity, JavaScript developers today have to make tough choices on how to organize their code and do so in a manner that both allows for growth and ease of management.
