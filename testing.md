    It's obvious that many people understand the benefits of unit tests—developers want to minimize the number of bugs in their code and managers want to reduce the amount of time required to test an application before release. Although the concept of unit testing has existed for years, software teams are only now beginning to explore building tests for their Rich Internet Applications (RIAs).

    A few months ago, I wrote a post titled [Automating Unit Tests](http://www.sencha.com/blog/automating-unit-tests/) that covered how developers could write unit tests for their business logic and validate their JavaScript syntax. Understanding these concepts is essential when building an enterprise application: bugs must be caught before changes are pushed into production or catastrophic consequences may follow.

- **(Guide)** [Unit Testing with Jasmine](http://docs.sencha.com/ext-js/4-1/#!/guide/testing) <small style='color:#aaa;'>&mdash; _docs.sencha.com_</small>    
    In this tutorial we will take an existing Ext application and introduce the Jasmine assertion library for unit testing. Readers must be familiar with JavaScript, Ext JS 4, the MVC architecture as well as the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and using resources.

- **(Video)** [Behavior Driven Testing with Jasmine (37:39)](http://docs.sencha.com/ext-js/4-1/#!/video/18100173) <small style='color:#aaa;'>&mdash; _Davis Frank_ on December 22, 2010</small>    
    An intro to Jasmine: BDD for JavaScript. We'll talk about why you want to use a test framework for JavaScript testing, why use Jasmine, and review its features, syntax and infrastructure, including how best to incorporate into a Sencha application.

- **(Blog)** [Headless Testing for Continuous Integration with Git and Jasmine](http://www.sencha.com/blog/headless-testing-for-continuous-integration-with-git-and-jasmine/) <small style='color:#aaa;'>&mdash; _Ariya Hidayat_ on January 14, 2011</small>    
    Our WebKit Team lead, Ariya Hidayat, walks you through creating a Continuous Integration setup that will run on Windows, Mac and Linux.

- **(Blog)** [Introducing Siesta: A Testing Tool for Ext JS](http://www.sencha.com/blog/introducing-siesta-a-testing-tool-for-ext-js/) <small style='color:#aaa;'>&mdash; _Mats Bryntse_ on December 14, 2011</small>    
    Siesta is a new unit testing framework for Ext JS and other JavaScript code. Testing Ext JS, or any JavaScript-centric web framework, can be difficult because the available tools are not really suited for the task. Most popular web UI testing tools don’t offer enough help unless your application uses simple static HTML pages. This is where Siesta is different from the rest, because its top priority is Ext JS testing.
