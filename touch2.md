  HTML5 has delivered on the promise to make building mobile apps work seamlessly across devices and operating systems. But developers looking to build applications still have to code HTML, JavaScript and CSS by hand, often laboriously rebuilding features that exist in native platforms without the benefit of tooling that native platforms offer. New tools in the HTML5 space, like Sencha Designer (now called Sencha Architect), make building mobile HTML5 apps as fun and easy as building native apps.

- **(Guide)** [How to use classes in Sencha Touch 2](http://docs.sencha.com/touch/2-1/#!/guide/class_system) <small style='color:#aaa;'>&mdash; _docs.sencha.com_</small>

  Sencha Touch 2.0 went through a huge refactoring from the ground up with the new class system. It combines the familiar class-based programming style with the dynamic nature of JavaScript into a robust architecture which stands behind every single class written in the frameworks. This session will give you a complete picture of everything our new foundation has to offer as well as their benefits and best practices.

  In Sencha Touch, the Component and Container form the basic building blocks for creating an interface. Each container can be assigned a Layout which handles the positioning of its inner items. The layouts work either by neatly arranging components to use the available space, or by showing just one component at a time and providing some way of changing the focus between them.

  GPU acceleration on mobile browsers, if it is leveraged correctly, can lead to a smooth and fluid applications, thus improving the user experience. There has been a lot of mentions and best practices of hardware acceleration these days, although so far it has been pretty general and hasn’t provided much technical direction apart from simple magical advice such as “use translate3d”. This talk sheds some more light on browser interactions with the GPU and explain what happens behind the scenes, covering the topic of acceleration of primitive drawing, the use of tiled backing store, and composited layer. Knowing the actual machinery behind hardware acceleration, you will be in the position to plan your strategy to improve the performance of your web application.
