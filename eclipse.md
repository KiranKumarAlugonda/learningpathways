  We've been working on various tools that make a Sencha developer's life easier, and we started with Sencha Architect. Our new plugin makes it even easier to use Architect by providing a full set of code completion and code assistance features for Eclipse.

  Sencha Cmd and Sencha Eclipse Plugin work great together. See how Sencha Cmd streamlines the process of setting up your model-view-controller Ext JS or Sencha Touch application and how Sencha Eclipse Plugin gives you code assist, error checking and type ahead support from the popular Eclipse IDE. Use both these Sencha tools together to dramatically reduce your app development time.
